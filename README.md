# Mars
  - **Deimos:** Martian moon
  - **Phobos:** Martian moon
  - **Day:** 25 hours; hour is 100 minutes
  - **Timestamp:** 17:89, 24:61, 08:12, 00:00
  - **Interval:** two timestamps during which a moon is visible
    - [04:97, 12:00]
    - [24:97, 08:00] -> if second timestamp smaller, then it's the next day
  - **Overlap Duration:** time during which both moons are visible in the sky
    - Edge case: [12:14, 18:14] [18:14, 20:01] -> 1 minute duration
# Architecture:
  - Implementation
  - Entry point takes two timestamps, outputs an integer (duration)
    - arbitrary decision, first is deimos second is phobos
    - can have a wrapper no-arg entrypoint main that lets you test
  - Overlap duration calculator
    - timestamp normalizer
      - should make it simple to compare timestamps
  - Tests
    - test each module
    - 15 assertions
    - some style of assertion, check slides
